# Tim Lytle (timlytle.net) — Content Ledger

> The memory of the engine. Read first on every `/seo` run: the **Shipped** table is the dedup record (never re-write a covered topic); the **Performance** table is the scoreboard (did the last pieces actually work?); the **Candidate backlog** is the scored shortlist so each run starts warm. Updated in the same edit batch as every piece shipped.

## Shipped

| Date | Title | Type | Slug / URL | Target keyword | Vol | Bucket | Original data (source · n · as-of) | Refresh due | Primary internal links | Commit / PR |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-11-02 | Indexing + entity baseline (canonicals, sitemap.xml, robots.txt, Person/Event JSON-LD, llms.txt) | repair + aeo-fix | site-wide (build/build.py) | n/a | n/a | n/a | none | n/a | n/a | uncommitted (working tree) |

<!-- Append one row per piece at Step 5. Type ∈ guide | how-to | listicle | definition | comparison | data-study | resource | opinion | case-study | tool -->
<!-- Tools: add a maintenance note to the row for anything with decaying data (fee schedules, rates, limits) — what expires and roughly when. -->
<!-- Original data: name the first-party element the piece carries (or "none — <ladder rung used>"). Refresh due: quarterly for volatile metrics, annual for structural ones, n/a if the piece carries no original data. The saved query lives in .seo/briefs/<slug>.md — re-running it is the cheapest high-value content run this engine has. -->

## Performance

> The closed loop. Filled by **Step 0.5** of a later run from GSC (`references/gsc.md` §2), seeded as `unmeasured` when a piece ships. Runs are stateless, so an unwritten measurement never happened. State ∈ winning | close | wrong-query | invisible | unmeasured | too-new | no-data (pre-window).
>
> **Backfilled:** never (GSC not connected) — set on the first GSC-aware run over an existing library (`gsc.md` §2b). Until it's set, assume no piece has ever been measured and backfill all of them in one pass before selecting anything.
>
> Adding this section to an older ledger? **Append it and match that file's own column style.** Don't renumber, reorder, or normalize the sections already there.

| Slug / URL | Published | Indexed? (state · checked) | Read @28d (clicks · impr · pos) | Read @56d (clicks · impr · pos) | Site-wide same window (clicks · impr) | Best lever (recover/CTR/rank · est. clicks) | State | Note / next action |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| site-wide | 2026-11-02 | unknown (no GSC) · 2026-11-02 | | | | | unmeasured | Verify GSC (NY-1), then read index coverage and the "Tim Lytle" query at 28d |

<!-- Two clocks. Index status: check ~3 days after deploy, on anything published in the last 30 days not yet confirmed indexed. Performance: measure any piece live 21+ days and not measured in the last 30. -->
<!-- Indexed? holds the coverage state verbatim (e.g. "Submitted and indexed", "Crawled - currently not indexed", "URL is unknown to Google", "noindex") plus the date checked. Each state has a different fix — see references/gsc.md §3a. -->
<!-- Read at ~28 and ~56 days after publish (or after a boost lands), not "whenever the skill next runs" — fixed checkpoints make rows comparable across pieces. -->
<!-- Site-wide same window is the CONTROL. Without it a Google-wide lift reads as your edit working. One get_performance_overview call. -->
<!-- Best lever: the largest of recover / CTR / rank in estimated clicks (references/gsc.md §2c). It decides both whether to boost and what kind of fix to write. -->
<!-- LOOP GATE: three published pieces in a row not indexed = the next run fixes that, not writes a fourth. -->
<!-- close (pos 5-15) → offer the boost at the next checkpoint, it often beats a new piece. -->
<!-- wrong-query → the queries it DID attract are a free candidate list for selection. -->
<!-- invisible after 21+ days → run inspect_url_enhanced BEFORE writing anything adjacent; not-indexed, noindex, wrong canonical, and thin each need a different fix. -->
<!-- Three invisible pieces in a row on one vein = the vein is dead. That verdict outranks any keyword-tool score. -->

## Candidate backlog

> Scored shortlist from the last selection run. Re-score when this is >30 days old or the user says "re-research." The next run reads this before regenerating the pool — it starts from here, validates the top pick is still open and winnable, and only does fresh research if needed.

| Rank | Candidate | Proposed type | Target keyword | Vol | Bucket (E/M/H · src) | Intent | Data angle | Score | Notes / angle |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Site: add an articles section (`/writing/`, article template, Article JSON-LD with author = Person @id, RSS feed, sitemap entries) | infrastructure | n/a | | | | | | Prerequisite for every row below. Each article links to its talk page and back. |
| 2 | Let Go of Ownership → series of short section-articles | opinion / essay | stewardship vs ownership (engineering) | ? | ? | informational | 7 attendee quotes, 3 deliveries (2023-2025) | | Most recent and most quoted. Needs demand evidence before it ships. |
| 3 | Is This Test Worth It? → article | guide | how to evaluate the value of a test | ? | ? | informational | Next delivery TechBash 2026 | | Strong search shape ("is X test worth it", unit vs integration vs e2e). |
| 4 | Yak Free Docker → article | how-to | docker for local dev tools (not deployment) | ? | ? | informational | 3 deliveries, 863-word abstract | | How-to format suits search; code examples give it real new information. |
| 5 | Building PHP Daemons → article | guide | php long running process / daemon | ? | ? | informational | Most-delivered talk (7) | | Evergreen technical query; check that the content is still current. |

<!-- PARKED 2026-11-03 (Tim): talk→article work waits until Tim restarts it. Pattern: one talk section = one short article on the site; Substack later gets the longer combined version. Don't select rows 1-5 until then. -->
<!-- Score = sum of winnability + traffic-potential + conversion-intent + strategic-value + data-angle + (6 - effort), each 1-5. See references/opportunity-research.md Step C. -->
<!-- Data angle: the specific first-party number or public-data combine this piece would carry, per references/proprietary-data.md. "None found" is a legitimate entry — an angle nobody can name isn't one. -->

> A running view of which clusters/themes have content and which are thin or empty. Helps spot topical-depth gaps the keyword tools miss. Fill in as the library grows.

## Notes

- **Difficulty buckets, not a KD cap:** Easy / Medium / Hard (`references/research-recipes.md`). Your playable bucket is the hardest one where GSC shows 2+ page-1 positions. Target it; allow one stretch pick in four one bucket up. Record the bucket AND which vendor's KD produced it — KD scales are vendor-specific and must never be compared across vendors.
- **No duplication:** before adding a candidate, check it isn't already a programmatic page in `.seo/roadmap.md` or a shipped row above.
- **One piece per run.** This ledger grows by one `Shipped` row per invocation.
- **Measure before you write.** Step 0.5 reads GSC for every piece live 21+ days and updates `Performance`. A `close` piece (position 5-15) is a boost candidate that regularly beats writing anything new, and an `invisible` piece is a question to answer before shipping its siblings.
- **Refresh beats rewrite.** Scan the `Refresh due` column at the start of every run. A piece whose original data is stale re-cuts in a fraction of a new run's cost — same URL, new numbers, renewed freshness, no new research — and answer engines reward the update. Do the refresh before starting a new piece when one is due.
- **Tool cadence:** if no `tool` row appears in the last 6 shipped pieces and a viable tool candidate exists, it takes the explore slot at the next checkpoint; none in the last 10 and it becomes the recommended pick. A library with no tool in it has no link magnet.
